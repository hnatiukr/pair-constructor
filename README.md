# pair-constructor

Pair for building abstractions with data. TypeScript supported.

[Documentation, API reference](https://github.com/hnatiukr/pair-constructor/tree/main/docs#table-of-contents)

## Motivation:

One of the most critical topics in programming is abstraction. The larger the codebase, the more abstractions are used or created. A significant part of the developer's time is spent modelling the domain and implementing it in code, as well as in its further support and development. As a rule, this issue is not given time at all, but the quality of your code depends on the ability to model, and how easy it will be to work with it and understand and modify it.

The idea of data abstraction is to define for each type of data object a set of basic operations through which all actions with objects of this type will be expressed.

-   it is easier for us to talk about the program because, at the level of abstraction at which we work, we operate with a small limited set of entities, which also correspond to the same level of thinking about them
-   it is easier for us to combine different parts of the program, glueing them together through the interfaces we have defined to obtain new more complex behaviour
-   it is much easier for us to maintain and change our programs, because the code, separated by an abstraction barrier at a certain level, does not depend on implementing lower levels. This allows individual levels to be overwritten at any time, for example for better performance.

A pair is a data structure that is the basis of compound data. Pairs don't exist in JavaScript/TypeScript. The idea is that the constructor creates a pair, and the selectors serve to extract the first value (using `car`) and the second value (using `cdr`) from the pair. Pairs are immutable. You can only create a new one based on the previous one.

A pair is only what is created using the cons constructor. If for some reason, not a pair was passed to the selectors, then the result will be just such an error: `Argument must be a pair, but it was ${ARG}`.

## Examples of building abstraction levels based on pairs

The correct way to build a data structure is to follow the principle of one level of abstraction. This means that when working in one subject area on a certain slice, one should operate with objects of this slice only, avoiding objects that do not belong to it.

**1. Lower abstraction level (pairs)**

```javascript
const pair = cons("first", "second");

car(pair); // => "first"
cdr(pair); // => "second"
isPair(pair); // true
toString(pair); // => "(first, second)"
```

**2. Higher abstraction level (coordinate plane points)**

```javascript
const makePoint = (a, b) => cons(a, b);
const getX = (point) => car(point);
const getY = (point) => cdr(point);

const getQuadrant = (point) => {
    const x = getX(point);
    const y = getY(point);

    switch (true) {
        case x > 0 && y > 0:
            return 1;
        case x < 0 && y > 0:
            return 2;
        case x < 0 && y < 0:
            return 3;
        case x > 0 && y < 0:
            return 4;
        default:
            return null;
    }
};

const getSymmetricalPoint = (point) => {
    const x = getX(point);
    const y = getY(point);

    return makePoint(-x, -y);
};

const calculateDistance = (point1, point2) => {
    const [x1, y1] = [getX(point1), getY(point1)];
    const [x2, y2] = [getX(point2), getY(point2)];

    return Math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2);
};

// ***

const point1 = makePoint(3, 4);
const point2 = makePoint(0, 0);

getX(point1); // => 3
getY(point2); // => 0
getQuadrant(point1); // 1
distance(point1, point2); // 5
getSymmetricalPoint(makePoint(1, 5)); // makePoint(-1, -5)
calculateDistance(makePoint(-2, -3), makePoint(-4, 4)); // â‰ˆ 7.28
```

**3. Highest abstraction level (objects on the coordinate plane)**

```javascript
const makeSegment = (point1, point2) => cons(point1, point2);

const startSegment = (segment) => car(segment);

const endSegment = (segment) => cdr(segment);

const segmentToString = (segment) => {
    const startToString = pointToString(startSegment(segment));
    const endToString = pointToString(endSegment(segment));

    return `[${startToString}, ${endToString}]`;
};

const midpointSegment = (point) => {
    const start = startSegment(point);
    const end = endSegment(point);

    const [x1, y1] = [getX(start), getY(start)];
    const [x2, y2] = [getX(end), getY(end)];

    const middleX = (x1 + x2) / 2;
    const middleY = (y1 + y2) / 2;

    return makePoint(middleX, middleY);
};

// ***

const segment = makeSegment(makePoint(1, 2), makePoint(-4, -2));
const point1 = startSegment(segment);
const point2 = endSegment(segment);

segmentToString(segment); // [(1, 2), (-4, -2)]
pointToString(point1); // (1, 2)
pointToString(point2); // (-4, -2)
pointToString(startSegment(segment)) === pointToString(makePoint(1, 2)); // true
pointToString(midpointSegment(segment)); // (-1.5, 0)
```

## Other examples

**Rational numbers**

```javascript
const make = (numer, denom) => cons(numer, denom);

const numer = (rat) => car(rat);

const denom = (rat) => cdr(rat);

const toString = (rat) => `${numer(rat)} / ${denom(rat)}`;

const isEqual = (rat1, rat2) =>
    numer(rat1) * denom(rat2) === denom(rat1) * numer(rat2);

const add = (rat1, rat2) => {
    const [a, b] = [numer(rat1), denom(rat1)];
    const [c, d] = [numer(rat2), denom(rat2)];

    return make(a * d + b * c, b * d); // (a * d + b * c) / (b * d)
};

const sub = (rat1, rat2) => {
    const [a, b] = [numer(rat1), denom(rat1)];
    const [c, d] = [numer(rat2), denom(rat2)];

    return make(a * d - b * c, b * d); // (a * d - b * c) / (b * d)
};

const mul = (rat1, rat2) => {
    const [a, b] = [numer(rat1), denom(rat1)];
    const [c, d] = [numer(rat2), denom(rat2)];

    return make(a * c, b * d); // (a * c) / (b * d)
};

const div = (rat1, rat2) => {
    const [a, b] = [numer(rat1), denom(rat1)];
    const [c, d] = [numer(rat2), denom(rat2)];

    return make(a * d, b * c); // (a * d) / (b * c)
};

// ***

const rat1 = make(2, 3);
const rat2 = make(4, 6);
const rat3 = make(7, 2);

toString(rat2); // '4 / 6'
isEqual(rat1, rat2); // true

add(rat1, rat3); // 25/6
sub(rat3, rat1); // 17/6
mul(rat1, rat3); // 14/6
div(rat1, rat3); // 4/21
```
